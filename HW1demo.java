  HW1 Instructions
  1. Create a class called "GameDriver" and save/name the file "GameDriver.java".
  2. The program shold start up with your text aventure splash screen (it would 
      be a good idea to use the one from Lab 1).
  3. Next, the program should have a print out of some storytelling that starts
      the text adventure.
  4. Then set up the game with questions asked from the user to start the text
      adventure (use same questions from Lab 2).
      TIP: Use Math.random and if-else to randomize elements in the game based 
        on user input. 
  5. When the game is over, end the program with a "GAME OVER" message.
  
  REMEMBER: 
  *Declare all your variables at the beginning of the program.
