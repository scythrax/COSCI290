  The purpose of this program is to take in user input
  and do basic math operatons.
  
  To-do: 
  1. Below every single comment line, write the appropriate java code.
  2. Make sure your program is free of errors and runs.
  2. Answer the following questions:
     a. What is the name of this class?
     b. What is the name of this file?
     c. What is the difference between a class name and a file name?
     d. What is the difference between importing Scanner and instantiating Scanner?
     
   Sample output of running this program:
   
   Please enter in a whole number.
   3
   The sum of 3 and 5 is 8
  
*/

//import Scanner for usage

public class Lab6{

  //entry point of app
  public static void main(String[] args){
    
    //instantiate the Scanner object for usage, call it input
    Scanner input = new scanner(System.in);
      
    //declare a variable that is type int and call this variable num
    int num = 3;
    
    //declare a variable that is type int and call this variable sum
    int sum = 
    
    //prompt the user with this message "Please enter in a whole number."

      
    /*
      using Scanner, which is called input, get the int from user input, 
      then assign it to the num variable
    */

    
    //add num to 5 and assign this to sum

    
    //prompt the user with the sum
    System.out.println("The sum of " + num + " and 5 is " + sum);
    
    
  }
  
}
